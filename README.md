## 🛠 Usage

Once set up, you will see:
- A device card for your **EZVIZ HP7 intercom**.
- Two services exposed:
  - `ezviz_hp7.unlock_door`
  - `ezviz_hp7.unlock_gate`

These can be used in **automations, scripts, and dashboards**.

Example automation:
```yaml
alias: Unlock gate on RFID card
trigger:
  - platform: state
    entity_id: sensor.rfid_reader
    to: "CARD_1234"
action:
  - service: ezviz_hp7.unlock_gate
    data:
      serial: BE7062577-BE6963574
```

## 🚧 Limitations

- **Live video streaming** is not yet supported inside Home Assistant.  
  The HP7 uses temporary tickets and relay servers, which are still under investigation.
- The integration currently supports **one HP7 device per account** (multi-device support planned).
